### **Procedure**

#### **1. Preparation of Specimen**
1. The dry material is prepared by mixing **cement and sand in 1:3 ratio** respectively by weight.  
2. **Water** is to be added in certain percentage of weight of dry material to prepare cement mix. The percentage of water to be added is **10%** for our test.  
3. For moulding, the **briquette mould** must be placed on bottom plate.  
4. A **thin layer of oil** must be applied to the mould before filling it with mortar mix.  
5. The mortar mix is to be filled in briquette moulds. After that, cover the mould with a **plane glass or metal plate oiled with mineral oil**, and turn over the mould and plates (held together with the hands) rotating the mould about its longitudinal axis.  
6. Remove the top plate and repeat the operation of **heaping, thumbing, and smoothing off**.

#### **2. Storage of Test Specimen**
After moulding, all the test specimens are to be **immersed in lime water storage tank** for the respective test ages, except for those specimens which will be tested in **24 hours**.

#### **3. Determination of Tensile Strength**
1. Tensile strength test is conducted on specimens at the following ages:

| **Test Age** | **Permissible Tolerance** |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| **24 h**     | ± 1/2 h                   |
| **3 days**   | ± 1 h                     |
| **7 days**   | ± 3 h                     |
| **28 days**  | ± 12 h                    |

2. During this period, specimens remain in the storage water tank.  
3. Before testing the specimen, **wipe each briquette to a surface‑dry condition**, and remove any loose sand grains or incrustations from the surfaces.  
4. Place the specimen carefully, aligning it along clips, and start the testing machine to apply load continuously at the rate of **3.5 kN/min**.  
5. Record the **total maximum load** at which the briquette fails.  

---

#### **Observation**
1. The **average of results** will be taken as tensile strength of that batch, except for any result which differs by more than **15%** of the average value.  
2. **Area of cross‑section of briquette**:  
   \[
   A = 1 \ \text{in}^2
   \]  
3. **Tensile strength formula**:  
   \[
   \text{Tensile Strength} = \frac{\text{Fractured Load}}{\text{Cross‑Section Area}}
   \]
