### Introduction
1. The ability of concrete to resist any kind of breaking or cracking due to tensile forces is called its tensile strength.Theproperty oftensile strength of concrete is not of much importance as usually concrete is subjected to compressive stresses. But still determination of tensile strength is important to have an idea about the cohesion in particles. Since Tensile strength and Compressive strength are closely related so the tensile strength test is used to substitute compressive test.
2. In this test the specimen is gripped on one end and with a constant strain it is pulled by uni-axial force. Before fracturing mortar will exhibit some elongation with increasing load till it got fractured. Through it we determine the maximum tensile stress or load it can bear.
3. The main aim of tensile test is to determine properties of material like modulus of elasticity, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elongation till fracture and reduction in area of specimen after it has been deformed.
